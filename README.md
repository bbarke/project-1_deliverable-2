# Project 1
## Deliverable 2: POC Code

### Project 1 High-Level Requirements

Project 1 is a RESTful Web Service that client(s) can create, read, update, delete or list notes.  A single note must contain four fields a name, body, username and tag(s).  

It also has an endpoint to create, update, delete a user.  A user object has a username, password (does not need to be hashed) and full name attributes.  The name, body, tag(s), username, password and full name are just plain text.  

The RESTful API does NOT require SSL or any type of authentication to be used.  The RESTful API does NOT require any type of persistent storage, meaning everything can be in memory (RAM).  In other words use PHP arrays for in-memory storage.  Follow the currently accepted standards concerning RESTful API's as discussed in class.

This assignment will be turned via pull-requests on the Github class site.
